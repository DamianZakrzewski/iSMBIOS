# DmiProperty.MemoryDevice.ConfiguredMemoryClockSpeed property

Gets a value representing the key to retrieve the property.

Memory speed is expressed in megatransfers per second (MT/s). Previous revisions (3.0.0 and earlier) of this specification used MHz to indicate clock speed.With double data rate memory, clock speed is distinct from transfer rate, since data is transferred on both the rising and the falling edges of the clock signal. This maintains backward compatibility with observed DDR implementations prior to this revision, which already reported transfer rate instead of clock speed, e.g., DDR4-2133 (PC4-17000) memory was reported as 2133 instead of 1066.
